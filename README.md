## Architecture

### MCP Protocol
The server implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides:
- Standardized tool discovery and invocation
- Type-safe parameter validation
- Structured error handling
- Automatic credential management

### Security
- API credentials are stored locally in Claude Desktop's config
- No credentials are transmitted over the network
- All Trello API calls use HTTPS
- Rate limiting is respected with automatic retry logic

### Technical Stack
- TypeScript for type safety
- MCP SDK for protocol implementation
- Zod for schema validation
- Fetch API for HTTP requests

### Testing
The server includes comprehensive error handling and validation. Test your setup by:
1. Checking Claude Desktop's MCP connection status
2. Running a simple command like "Show me my Trello boards"
3. Verifying the response includes your board data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No Trello tools available"**
   - Ensure Claude Desktop is fully restarted after configuration
   - Check that the path in config points to `dist/index.js`
   - Verify the file exists and is built

2. **"Invalid credentials"**
   - Double-check your API key and token
   - Ensure token has read/write permissions
   - Regenerate token if needed

3. **"Rate limit exceeded"**
   - The server includes automatic retry logic
   - Wait a few minutes if you hit limits
   - Consider reducing request frequency
